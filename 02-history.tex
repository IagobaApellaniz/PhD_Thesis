\lettrine[lines=2, findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{M}{etrology} as the science of measuring has played an essential role for the development of the technology as it is nowadays.
It studies several aspects of the actions involved on a measurement. 
Metrology covers from the physical design of a precise measuring device until the most basic concept of nature which lead in ultimate instance to the better understanding of the process. 

In this sense, with the discovery of the Quantum Physics and the development of Quantum Mechanics, new doors for advances in metrology were open on the earlies decades of the 19th century.
Later on, the Quantum Theory lead to the so called field of Quantum Information which merges the notions of the computer science among others with the quantum mechanics.
The role of the so-called entanglement, an esclusive feature of Quantum Mechanics, is esential in this context.
Its complete understanding has integrated efforts of many researches world wide.
Said this, the entanglement also is in the center of theoretical concepts included in Quantum Metrology.
