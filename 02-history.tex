\lettrine[lines=2, findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{M}{etrology} as the science of measuring has played an essential role for the development of the technology as it is  known today.
It studies several aspects of the actions involved on a measurement.
Metrology covers from the physical design of a precise measuring device until the most basic concept of nature which lead in ultimate instance to the better understanding of the process. 

In this sense, with the discovery of the Quantum Physics and the development of Quantum Mechanics, new doors for advances in metrology were open on the earlies decades of the 19th century.
Later on, the Quantum Theory lead to the so called field of Quantum Information which merges the notions of the computer science, among others, with the quantum mechanics.
The role of the so-called entanglement, an exclusive feature of Quantum Mechanics, is essential in this context.
Its complete understanding has integrated efforts of many researches world wide.
Said this, the entanglement also is in the center of theoretical concepts included in Quantum Metrology.

On the other hand and with the aim of interpreting raw data, there are the statistics, without which many descriptions of the actual and past physical findings would lack of the rigorous interpretation needed for the complexity of data samples.



\subsection{Background on probability theory}
One of the main tools required for the theoretical advance on metrology is the so-called probability theory.
And for that reason, we will go trough the points of probability theory in this section.

The probability theory analyses a set of random data, in most cases outcomes of some process, and with such analysis essential features or information in principle not so visible from the raw data is obtained. For example, we can have samples of the outcomes of a coin, 1 for heads and 0 for
