\lettrine[lines=2, findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{T}{ypically}, one has not access to the density matrix of the system been used for metrology or for other quantum process.
Moreover, for systems on which the particle number is very large, this is the case when one wants to do metrology with quantum states, the details of the density matrix are forbidden by practical reasons.
Since the quantum Fisher information is based on the complete knowledge of the density matrix, shortcuts to avoid the complete tomography must be developed as we have had shown one practical case on the previous chapter.
In this chapter, we obtain a general procedure to get an optimal bound for the quantum Fisher information based on as many expectation values of the initial state as one is ready to measure.
Two main features are worth to mention again.
First, in general this method gives us an optimal tight bound.
Last but not least, the bound is based on the expectation values of the initial state only, so it is not necessary to perform an evolution of the state to estimate how well will it behave.
This is in contrast to other approaches one can find in the literature, an it is a time saving concept.

The figure of merit of bounds from below for the quantum Fisher information based on expectation values of the initial state is the following,
\be
  \mathcal{F}_{\text{Q}} [\rho,J_z] \geq \frac{\expect{J_x}^2}{\varian{J_y}}.
\ee
where the state is polarized along the $Ox$-axis and the variance of the $J_y$ operator is smaller than the standard.
On the previous chapter we also have shown one of these bound specifically designed for unpolarized Dicke states.

Homogeneous magnetometry, $\bs{B} = B\bs{k}$ where $B$ is constant in time.

Quantum Fisher information $\mathcal{F}_{\text{Q}} [\rho, J_z]$.

\subsection{Minimum of a convex funtion of the states based on the expectation values}

Convex function of states, $g(\rho)$.

Which is the lowest possible value of $g(\rho)$ for a state where some expectation values of $\{W_{i}\}_{i=0}^M$ operators, $w_i = \tr(\rho {W}_i)$ are known?

Such bound is defined,
\be
  g(\rho) \geq \mathcal{B}_{g}(w_1,w_2,...)
\ee

For this purpose we use simplify our discourse to one observable or equivalently one parameter, $w = \tr(\rho W)$ and formally the bound is defined as follows,
\be
  g(\rho) \geq \big\{ \mathcal{B}_{g}(w) := \min_{\rho}  g(\rho) \;|\; w = \tr(\rho W)\big\}.
\ee

The bound from below of such a funtion $g(\rho)$ is convex too [NEED TO BE SHOWN?].

Therefore, we use the Legendre transform to get rid out of the state and still keep all the necessary information to reconstruct the $\mathcal{B}_{g}$ bound.
\be
  \hat{g}(rW) = \sup_{\rho}\{ r\expect{W}_{\rho}-g(\rho)\}
\ee
[FIGURE OF CONVEXITY]

Now we have the Legendre transform, we recover the bound from below of $g(\rho)$ as
\be
  \mathcal{B}_g (w) = \sup_{r}\big\{rw-\sup_{\rho}\{r\expect{W}_{\rho}-g(\rho)\}\big\}.
\ee
To clarify, notice that the $\rho$ appearing on the inner maximization is in principle not related with the one appearing on $g(\rho)$.

This equation has been applied on entanglement measures, when $g(\rho)$ is defined as using the convex roof construction.
On that case when the function $g(\rho)$ is extended from the well defined region for pure states to the mixed states using the convex roof construction,
\be
  g(\rho) = \inf_{\{p_k,\ket{\phi_k}\}}\big\{\sum_{k}p_k g(\ket{\phi_k})\big\}
\ee
for any decomposition $\rho=\sum_k p_k \ketbra{\phi_k}{\phi_k}$, the Equation~[XX] can be further simplified.
Let us focus on the inner maximization,
\be
\begin{split}
  \hat{g}(rW) & = \sup_{\rho}\{r\expect{W}_\rho - g(\rho)\} \\
  &=\sup_{\rho}\Big\{r\expect{W}_\rho - \inf_{\{p_k,\ket{\phi_k}\}}\big\{\sum_{k} p_k g(\ket{\phi_k})\big\} \Big\} \\
  &=\sup_{\{p_k, \ket{\phi_k}\}} \Big\{ \sum_k p_k r\expect{W}_{\ket{\phi_k}} - \inf_{\{p_k, \ket{\phi_k}\}} \big\{\sum_k p_k g(\ket{\phi_k}) \big\}  \Big\} \\
  &=\sup_{\{p_k, \ket{\phi_k}\}} \Big\{ \sum_k p_k \big\{ r\expect{W}_{\ket{\phi_k}} - g(\ket{\phi_k}) \big\} \Big\} \\
  &=\sup_{\ket{\psi}} \big\{ r\expect{W}_{\ket{\psi}} - g(\ket{\psi}) \big\}.
\end{split}
\ee
So now we have restricted the maximization to only pure states.

Further simplification can be achieved for quantum Fisher information,
\be
\begin{split}
  \hat{\mathcal{F}}_{\text{Q}}(rW) &= \sup_{\ket{\psi}}\big\{r\expect{W}_{\ket{\psi}}-4\varian{J_z}_{\ket{\psi}}\big\} \\
  &= \sup_{\ket{\psi}} \big\{ r\expect{W}_{\ket{\psi}}-4\expect{J_z^2}_{\ket{\psi}} + 4\expect{J_z}^2_{\ket{\psi}} \big\}
\end{split}
\ee

This can be extended for several observables.
\be
  \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{F}}(w_1,w_2,...)
\ee
