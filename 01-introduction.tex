The figure of merit for the precision is the inverse of the variance normalized with the number of particles, $(\Delta \Theta)^{-2}/N$. It has the following properties:

(i) The bigger it is the bigger is the precision

(ii) It is normalized so for the best separable state it is 1.
For greater values than 1 it would be a non-classical sign.

This thesis consists of 4 well differentiated parts, apart from the current introduction, on which different topics are developed.
In the first part, we will introduce the reader onto the research field of quantum metrology.

Brief comments on the notation: $\text{c}_{\Theta}$ and ${\rm s}_{\Theta}$ stand for $\cos\Theta$ and $\sin\Theta$ respectively, probably some other trigonometry function is shortened.
We will omit the use of the tensor-product notation, $\otimes$, if there is not necessary for the correct comprehension of the text
