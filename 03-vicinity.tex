\lettrine[lines=2, findent=3pt,nindent=0pt]{I}{n} this chapter I will present recent results regarding the metrological usefulness of particular unpolarized states~\cite{Apellaniz2015}.
Those states interact with an external magnetic field through the magnetic momentum generated by the total spin, as it is explained on the previous Section~\ref{sec:bg-quantum-metro}.
While the following results and the corresponding mathematics are obtained only for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, those can be generalised for higher spins.

One of the figures of merit of this such unpolarized but still useful states is the so-called unpolarized Dicke state [XXX], which consists of, on its $Oz$-axis  representation, an equal number of qubits pointing up and pointing down while the whole state is symmetrised,
\be
  \ket{\text{D}_N^{0}} \equiv \ket{\text{D}_{N}}:= \binom{N}{N/2}^{-\frac{1}{2}}
  \sum_{k\in \sigma_{\text{s}}}
  P_k\left( \ket{1}^{\otimes N/2} \ket{0}^{\otimes N/2}
  \right).
  \label{eq:vd-unpolarised-dicke}
\ee
Such state is known to be highly entangled [XXX].

The symmetric subspace of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles is decomposed in $N+1$ orthonormal states, see Appendix~\ref{app:angular-subspaces} for more details on how such subspaces behave even for different spins.
Indeed, the subspace can be seen as a single spin-$\frac{N}{2}$ particle while the state remains on such subspace.

One of the most particular features that this state has is that since it is a eigenstate of the collective operator $J_z$ with corresponding eigenvalue equal to zero.
At the same time, it lives on the subspace where the collective total spin is maximum\ie $\expect{\bs{J}^2}=N(N+2)/4$.
Thus, with this together with the fact that the state is unpolarised, it turns that it must have a very large uncertainty for the collective spin operators perpendicular to $J_z$, namely $J_x$ and $J_y$.

\subsection{Unpolarised states for magnetometry}

Having unpolarised states for magnetometry has been shown useful in Section~XX.
While the quantum Fisher information would give directly the performance one state would have, this is not feasible in general because a complete knowledge of the state is needed to compute it.
On the other hand, we can use the error propagation formula Equation~(XX) to obtain a bound on the precision.
As one can see on the Figure~\ref{fig:vd-secuence-evo} a pure Dicke state is rotated along the $Oz$-axis.
Say that in this case the initial state is an unpolarised Dicke state of aligned with the $Ox$-axis.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.65]{img/plots/VD_evolution_of_dicke.pdf}
  \caption{Secuence of the evolution of an unpolarized Dicke state of 16 qubits for $\Theta=\{i\pi/6\}_{i=0}^4$. Bloch spheres representing the Hirusi distribution of the state, and below PDF of the $J_x$ POVM for each step of the secuence}
  \label{fig:vd-secuence-evo}
\end{figure}

The state initially is an eigenstate of the $J_x^k$ operators for $\forall k \in [1,\infty]$.
Another feature of the sequence is that $\expect{J_l}=0$ for $\forall l\in x,y,z$.
It turns out that measuring the evolution of the second statistical moment of $J_x$ is one of the ways to go.
It will start having value equal to zero for the pure unpolarized Dicke state, and rapidly will increase its value as it can be seen on the Figure~\ref{fig:vd-secuence-evo}.
Another heuristic observation is that for $\Theta=\pi/2$ the value of $\expect{J_x^2}$ will be at its maximum been it proportional to $\expect{\bs{J}^2}$ so to $N^2$.
Hence, the change on the second moment over the phase shift must be in this case proportional to $N^2$.
From this and for those states, we lead to the conclusion that one only needs to measure the second moment of the collective spin $J_x$ to observe precisions that scale with the Heisenberg limit.
In the following equation we show the error propagation formula that will give us the obtained precision,
\be
  \varian{\Theta} = \frac{\varian{J_x^2}}{|\partial_{\Theta} \expect{J_x}|^2}.
  \label{eq:vd-error-propagation}
\ee

\subsection{Evolution of the expectation values}
With the aim of computing the precision, Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-error-propagation})}, we will compute the dependence on $\Theta$ of the expectation value of the operator $J_x$ and higher order moments.
For that first of all we will move onto the Heisenberg picture where the operators evolve in time while the state remains the same.
The operator $J_x$ can be written a a function of $\Theta$ the following way,
\be
  J_x(\Theta) = e^{i \Theta J_z} J_x(0) e^{-i \Theta J_z} = J_x(0) \text{c}_\Theta - J_y(0) \text{s}_{\Theta},
\ee
where $J_l(0)$ for $\forall l$ are the collective angular momentum operators at time equal zero, which we will write them simply $J_l$ from now on, and $\text{c}_\Theta$ and $\text{s}_\Theta$ are the trigonometric functions introduced on the first chapter.

We need to compute the second and the fourth moments of $J_x$ as it is required by the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-error-propagation})}.
But before any calculation we will make a simplifying assumption which turn to be well supported on the most common situations.
The assumption is that both expectation values are even functions on $\Theta$,
\be
  \begin{split}
    \expect{J_x^2(\Theta)} &=\expect{J_x^2(-\Theta)}, \\
    \expect{J_x^4(\Theta)} &=\expect{J_x^4(-\Theta)}.
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:vd-even-f-constraint}
\ee

The square of $J_x$ in the Heisenberg picture is written as follows,
\be
  J_x^2(\Theta)= J_x^2 \text{c}_\Theta^2 + J_y^2 \text{s}_\Theta^2
  - (J_xJ_y + J_yJ_x) \text{c}_\Theta\text{s}_\Theta.
\ee
From the equation above and to fulfill the first constraint on the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-even-f-constraint})} it turns out that the expectation value over our yet to be shown initial state of the operator $(J_xJ_y + J_yJ_x)$ must vanish.
Hence it is equivalent to the first assumption of the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-even-f-constraint})} write that
\be
  \expect{\{J_x,J_y\}} = 0
  \label{eq:vd-init-2nd-constraint}
\ee
where $\{\, ,\,\}$ stands for the anticommutator.
Apart for been simpler to compute the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-init-2nd-constraint})} is based also on initial expectation values of the state.
We will see that as we said before this is easily guarantied for most important cases.

As we have done recently with the square of $J_x$ now we will do it for $J_x^4$.
This way one will be able to distinguish which other combination of operators must vanish in order to have Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-even-f-constraint})} guarantied. The fourth power of $J_x$ can be written as follows in the Heisenberg picture,
\begin{multline}
  J_x^4(\Theta)= J_x^4 \text{c}_\Theta^4 + J_y^4 \text{s}_\Theta^4
  + (J_x^2J_y^2 + J_xJ_yJ_xJ_y + J_xJ_y^2J_x + J_yJ_xJ_yJ_x + J_yJ_x^2J_y + J_y^2J_x^2) \text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2 \\
  -(J_x^3J_y+J_x^2J_yJ_x+J_xJ_yJ_x^2+J_yJ_x^3)\text{c}_\Theta^3\text{s}_\Theta
  -(J_xJ_y^3+J_yJ_xJ_y^2+J_y^2J_xJ_y+J_y^3J_x)\text{c}_\Theta\text{s}_\Theta^3.
\end{multline}
And again assuming that its expectation value must be an even function on $\Theta$ it turns out that the second line must be equal to zero when the expectation value is considered.
So $(J_x^3J_y+J_x^2J_yJ_x+J_xJ_yJ_x^2+J_yJ_x^3)$ and $(J_xJ_y^3+J_yJ_xJ_y^2+J_y^2J_xJ_y+J_y^3J_x)$ must vanish again over any candidate state to be used as prove state.
Hence, the second constraint of the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-even-f-constraint})} can be rewritten as follows,
\be
  \begin{split}
    \expect{\big\{J_x^2 , \{ J_x,J_y\}\big\}}=0,\\
    \expect{\big\{J_y^2 , \{ J_x,J_y\}\big\}}=0.
  \end{split}
\ee

Finally, we can write how the evolution of second and fourth moments of the $J_x$ operator must look like,
\begin{align}
  \expect{J_x^2(\Theta)}=\; &\expect{J_x^2} \text{c}_\Theta^2 + \expect{J_y^2} \text{s}_\Theta^2
  \label{eq:vd-evo-2nd-moment}\\
  \begin{split}
    \expect{J_x^4(\Theta)}=\; &
    \expect{J_x^4}\text{c}_\Theta^4 + \expect{J_y^4} \text{s}_\Theta^4 \\
    & + \expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2} \text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2.
  \end{split}
\end{align}
From here we are able to write the evolution of the variance of the second moment when Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-even-f-constraint})} must be obeyed.
We obtain
\be
  \begin{split}
    \varian{J_x^2(\Theta)} &= \expect{J_x^4(\Theta)} -\expect{J_x^2(\Theta)}^2 \\
    &= \expect{J_x^4}\text{c}_\Theta^4 + \expect{J_y^4} \text{s}_\Theta^4
    + \expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2} \text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2
    - \big(\expect{J_x^2} \text{c}_\Theta^2 + \expect{J_y^2} \text{s}_\Theta^2\big)^2\\
    &= \big(\expect{J_x^4}-\expect{J_x^2}^2\big)\text{c}_\Theta^4
    + \big(\expect{J_y^4}-  \expect{J_y^2}^2\big)\text{s}_\Theta^4
    + \big(\expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2} - 2 \expect{J_x^2}\expect{J_y^2}\big)
    \text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2\\
    &=\varian{J_x^2}\text{c}_\Theta^4 + \varian{J_y^2} \text{s}_\Theta^4+ \big(\expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2} - 2 \expect{J_x^2}\expect{J_y^2}\big)\text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2.
  \end{split}
\ee

The remaining constituent of the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-error-propagation})} on which we will base our result for the precision, is the modulus square of the derivative of the second moment of the $J_x$ operator.
Using Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-evo-2nd-moment}) for the expression of the evolution of the second moment, the denominator of Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-error-propagation})} follows
\be
  \begin{split}
    |\partial_\Theta \expect{J_x^2(\Theta)}|^2 & = |-2\expect{J_x^2}\text{c}_\Theta\text{s}_\Theta+2\expect{J_y^2}\text{c}_\Theta\text{s}_\Theta|^2\\
    & = 4\expect{J_y^2-J_x^2}^2\text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2.
  \end{split}
\ee

From the equations above directly follows expression for the precision of $\Theta$,
\be
\begin{split}
  \varian{\Theta} & = \frac{\varian{J_x^2}\text{c}_\Theta^4 + \varian{J_y^2} \text{s}_\Theta^4+ \big(\expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2} - 2 \expect{J_x^2}\expect{J_y^2}\big)\text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2}
  {4\expect{J_y^2-J_x^2}^2\text{c}_\Theta^2\text{s}_\Theta^2}\\
  & = \frac{\varian{J_x^2}\text{t}_\Theta^{-2} + \varian{J_y^2} \text{t}_\Theta^2+ \expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2} - 2 \expect{J_x^2}\expect{J_y^2}}
  {4\expect{J_y^2-J_x^2}^2}.
\end{split}
\label{eq:vd-result-before-simp}
\ee
To this calculations further computations follows mainly regarding to the following expectation value $\expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2}$.
This calculus is left for the Appendix~{\ref{ap:loca-simplification}}.
Finally, the expression Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-result-before-simp})} leads to the following,
\be
  \varian{\Theta} = \frac{\varian{J_x^2}\text{t}_\Theta^{-2} + \varian{J_y^2} \text{t}_\Theta^2 + 3\expect{J_y^2} - 2 \expect{J_z^2} - 2\expect{J_x^2}(1+\expect{J_y^2}) + 6\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}}
  {4\expect{J_y^2-J_x^2}^2}
  \label{eq:vd-precision-as-theta}
\ee
[IT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PUBLICATION..., This difference would make invariant all the results except the plot SPSQ -> QFI vs BOUND, which in this case the bound gets improved!!]

One can realize that the whole dependence on the phase shift is in the first two terms of the numerator.
This way one can minimize the sum on the first two terms in order to find where the precision is best.
So it follows that,
\be
  \tan^2(\Theta_{\text{opt}}) = \sqrt{\frac{\varian{J_x^2}}{\varian{J_y^2}}}
\ee
which inserted on the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-precision-as-theta})} gives us the optimal precision when the second moment $\expect{J_x^2}$ is measured based on the initial expectation values of the input state. The optimal precision is written in the following way,
\be
  \varian{\Theta} = \frac{\sqrt{\varian{J_x^2} \varian{J_y^2} } + 3\expect{J_y^2} - 2 \expect{J_z^2} - 2\expect{J_x^2}(1+\expect{J_y^2}) + 6\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}}
  {4\expect{J_y^2-J_x^2}^2}.
  \label{eq:vd-precision}
\ee.

We conclude with this section checking our bound for the pure unpolarised Dicke state aligned with $Ox$, $\ket{\text{D}_N}_x$, whose precision bound is well known, Equation~{([XXX])}.
With this aim we compute all the expectation values needed for the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-precision})} which almost all of them are trivial, $\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}=\expect{J_x^4}=\expect{J_x^2}=0$.
The rest are obtained in the following way,
\begin{align}
  \expect{J_y^2} & = \expect{J_z^2} = \frac{N (N+2)}{8},
  \label{eq:vd-2moment-pure-dicke}\\
  \expect{J_y^4} & = \frac{N+2}{8}\left(\frac{3N(N+2)}{16}-\frac{1}{2}\right).
  \label{eq:vd-4y-moment-pure-dicke}
\end{align}
The Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-2moment-pure-dicke})} follows directly from the fact that the state is invariant under rotations on the $Ox$ axis, so they are its expectation values, because the sum of all the second moments must give the value of the total angular momentum, in this case the maximum which is $\expect{\bs{J}^2} = \frac{N (N+2)}{4}$, and because $\expect{J_x^2}=0$.
The proof of the Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-4y-moment-pure-dicke})} needs more algebra and has been left for the Appendix~{\ref{ap:}}.

From the equations above, one lead to the following expression for the precision of the phase shift for a pure unpolarised Dicke state,
\be
  \varian{\Theta} = \frac{2}{N(N+2)},
\ee
which coincides exactly with the quantum Fisher information for the state.

\subsection{Testing the formula against some known states}

In this section we will compare our criteria based on few expectation values against the corresponding quantum Fisher information obtained for some known input states.
Those input states will be first the family of states defined as the ground states of the following Hamiltonian, called the spin-squeezing Hamiltonian,
\be
  H_\lambda = J_x^2 - \lambda J_y.
\ee
For $\lambda$ equal to zero we have the unpolarized Dicke state, Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-unpolarised-dicke})}, and for $\lambda$ large we recover the coherent totally polarized state pointing onto the $Oy$ direction.
In the meantime the state is also a spin-squeezed state, therefore the name of the Hamiltonian.

The second family of input states we are going use are the Gaussian mixture of Dicke states around the unpolarized Dicke state, which have the following form as function of $\beta$,
\be
  \rho_{\text{th}}(T) \propto \sum_{m=-N/2}^{N/2} e^{- \frac{m^2}{T}} \ket{\text{D}_N^m}_x\bra{\text{D}_N^m}_x.
\ee

\end{figure}

After showing how the optimal precision formula behaves compared with the quantum Fisher information for those two families of states, we also have to proof that they indeed fulfill the constraints on Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-even-f-constraint})}.
