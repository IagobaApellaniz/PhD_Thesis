In this appendix we will develop long calculations appeared throughout different chapters.

\subsection[Simplification of the Eq.~{(\ref{eq:vd-result-before-simp})}]
{Simplification of $\expect{\{J_x^2,J_y^2\}+\{J_x,J_y\}^2}$}
\label{ap:loca-simplification}

The expectation value appearing on Equation~{(\ref{eq:vd-result-before-simp})} which we want to simplify has 6 different terms, all with two $J_x$ and another two $J_y$,
\be
  \expect{J_x^2J_y^2} + \expect{J_xJ_yJ_xJ_y} + \expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}
  + \expect{J_yJ_x^2J_y} + \expect{J_yJ_xJ_yJ_x} + \expect{J_y^2J_x^2}.
\ee
From all those terms the third is somehow referent, since the pure unpolarised Dicke state used as reference is align with the $Ox$-axis, so $J_x\ket{D_N^{N/2}}_x=0$.

We use the commutation relations of the angular momentum operators $[J_k,J_l]=\epsilon_{klm} iJ_m$ to rearrange all operators,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \expect{J_x^2J_y^2} & = i\expect{J_xJ_zJ_y}+\expect{J_xJ_yJ_xJ_y},
  \label{eq:ap-simplification-1} \\
  \expect{J_xJ_yJ_xJ_y} & = i\expect{J_xJ_yJ_z}+\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x},
  \label{eq:ap-simplification-2} \\
  \expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x} & = \expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x},
  \label{eq:ap-simplification-3} \\
  \expect{J_yJ_x^2J_y} & = i\expect{J_yJ_xJ_z} + \expect{J_yJ_xJ_yJ_x},
  \label{eq:ap-simplification-4} \\
  \expect{J_yJ_xJ_yJ_x} & = -i\expect{J_zJ_yJ_x} + \expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x},
  \label{eq:ap-simplification-5} \\
  \expect{J_y^2J_x^2} & = -i\expect{J_xJ_yJ_z} + \expect{J_yJ_xJ_yJ_x}.
  \label{eq:ap-simplification-6}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
One may notice that with those relations is enough to see that we have six $\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}$, for instance, Equation~{(\ref{eq:ap-simplification-1})} is $i\expect{J_xJ_zJ_y}$ plus Equation~{(\ref{eq:ap-simplification-2})} which at the same time is $i\expect{J_xJ_yJ_z}$ plus Equation~{(\ref{eq:ap-simplification-3})}.
So each equation has at the end one $\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}$ plus or minus some expectation value of the product of three operators.

If we sum all again, and we subtract $6\expect{J_xJ_y^2J_x}$ we will end with those three operator expectation values. They look like follows,
\be
  i\expect{J_xJ_zJ_y}+2i\expect{J_xJ_yJ_z}+i\expect{J_yJ_xJ_z}-3i\expect{J_zJ_yJ_x}-i\expect{J_xJ_yJ_z}.
\ee
Again using the commutation relations we can further simplify this expression.
