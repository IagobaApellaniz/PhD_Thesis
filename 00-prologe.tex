This work is part of doctoral project which I started on the sumer of 2013.
This work collects almost all the research I have done on those previous years.
I try to be as clear as possible, writing from the very basics concepts of modern Quantum Physics until the most recent results on Quantum Metrology and Quantum Information in a clear and concise way, such that it is understandable for a more general public.

The research work I collect in this thesis was done in collaboration with members of the group I belong to.
Even if not all of them are at the present day investigating on our group, the collaborators namely were Dr. Philipp Hyllus, Dr. Giuseppe Vitagliano, Dr. I\~nigo Urizar-Lanz, Dr. Z\'oltan Z\'inboras, Dr. Matthias Kleinmann and Prof. G\'eza T\'oth.
Apart from the group GEDENPQOT, based on Bilbao, this thesis also collects some works done in collaboration with the group Theoretical Quantum Optics lead by Prof. Otfried G\"uhne of the University of Siegen, in Germany, and the group of Prof. Carsten Klempt at the Universitu of Hannover, in Germany too.
